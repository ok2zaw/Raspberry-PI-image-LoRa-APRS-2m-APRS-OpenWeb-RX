# Raspberry PI image with LoRa APRS iGate, 2m APRS (RTL-SDR) and OpenWeb RX (RTL-SDR)

Project description
It is exactly one year from my first LoRa APRS test. Thanks to Ondra OK1CDJ who sent me first device for testing. I have opened Facebook room about LoRa APRS a few weeks ago. Thanks this more and more people is interested to try it. Thats why I have decided to prepare Raspberry PI (3 or 4) SD card image for PnP - you need to change your station data. You can use this image for LoRa APRS iGate based on IOT4pi project, also 2m (70cm) classic APRS based on RTL-SDR and OpenWeb RX.
